<h4> My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. what could yours be? (09.05) </h4>
			1. It was interesting to read about how the internet works through servers. It is true that today a website can be very different. It can be designed in a million new ways by web designers or anyone learning to code for web. I enjoyed her comparison of nature to websites and how they relate in the way a site can function. A website can be anything the person making it wants it to be. How can we showcase our work and selved authentically versus how we showcase ourselves on social media? Does the platform change the message?

<h4> What is code (09.12) </h4>
			2. The visualization of the information being covered in this article was helpful to understand the information. The interactive cirquitry that computes while we watch, shows a clear visual of how these cirquits work. The article mentions that so many things are or will be computors in the future. It's scary to think about everything changing in this direction, but is inevatble. Thinking about how interactions or functions will change from this computerization is also scary, yet can be exciting. The code visual for using keyboards so crazy to try. The information is a bit hard to follow, but makes me think about how i'm glad someone is this smart and can code all these things. Thank you coders.

<h4> Websites are the art of our times (09.19) </h4>
			3. Websites are compared to the world as unvisited territories, since there's so many ways to code and create a website,  have it function a specific way or discover new things it can do. Websites can live in their own space as art online. This creates endless amounts of possibility. The unpredictaable quaality of this space on the web allows for artists to create unuique digital art that can be it's own online experience within that space.

<h4> Google (09.26)</h4>
			4. The google material design guide is reallly helpful and easy to navigate. The way it is layed out helps to understand different topics like the "dark theme". It explains the user interface for this theme. The limited color usage is very appealing to many users. I also use this dark theme. Theres also another section called icon guide that gives specifications for the icons used. It was intersting to see how this information could be applied to fit their style guides.

<h4> Scroll, skim, stare (10.03) </h4>
			5. Artist's website gives them a place to showcase their work online, like an online art gallery. This is important for every artists to have since we can give ourselves an online presensce of our work. Thinking of an online space compared to a gallery in physical space allows us to think about how we would want to show our work online. Unique experiences can be designed to showcase work online in a more interesting way.

<h4> In defense of the poor image (10.10) </h4>
			6. The article says "the poor image tends towards abstraction, it is a visual idea in its very becoming", poor images can be easliy abstracted and shared and distorted for anyone personal use. Their meaning can be changed and use for anyones purpose. It's interesting to think about how does an image gain value or lose it's value and what is an image's worth. 

<br>



<h4>  A handmade web (10.17) </h4>
			7. This shows how handmade work, like zines, can be preserved online. Websites can be used as a database to hold older, handmade documents. This articles seems very poetic about using online space to preserve these documents and how the technology always is changing, yet the documents are held online in this space.

<h4> Top 10 web design styles of 1993 (10.24)</h4>
			8. This was a very strange layout for an article and was a bit confusing. He epxlains different elements that can add to a website like the name, url and tags you can use. He says adding gifs can also make it less serious, but the one's shown are very outdated and funny to have on a website. 

<br>


<h4> Apple (10.31)</h4>
			9. This article explains the IOS design themes to design an amazing app. The 3 points are clarity, deference and depth. I agree that these are key elements to make a website easy to interact with and essential to create the user experience that works well with a user interface. Clarity to me is the most important because without it, it is not user friendly. 

<br>


<h4> Research and destroy (11.07) </h4>
			10. This reading was really interesting to analyze the need for things, and if the design adds value to it or if we just desire is more for our wants. Design itself adds its own value to the object that is designed. This gives it a unique story and style that draws in a consumer to want to invest in the design. The idea of "design generating longing" is something I agree with because consumers are focused on the aesthetic quality that draws them in and can be flashy to others.

<h4>  Can jokes bring down the government? (11.14)  </h4>
			11. The idea of "memes and jokes as political tools" is interesting to think about since making a meme ccan create commentary about a political subject and cause people to question the topic by hilighting it as a joke and bringing down from the serious topic that it might otherwise be. They describe it as an exersize in "sense making". The joke makes a hard topic aproachable and easier to question or tackle. 

<br>

<h4> Against software development (11.21) </h4>
			12. The statement of "Beautiful code gets rewritten; ugly code survives" was confusing at first. Later thinking about it as something that becomes more complex that can survive since we can learn more from this. The beautiful code is self explanatory, and ideas of beauty are constatly shifting and creating better ways of executing these ideas of aesthetics.
